Q. List out the features of HTML5

HTML5 introduced numerous new features and improvements over its predecessors. Here are some key features of HTML5:

1. **Semantic Elements**: HTML5 introduced semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer`, making it easier to structure web pages with meaningful elements.

2. **Audio and Video**: Built-in support for audio and video elements (`<audio>` and `<video>`) with native playback controls, making multimedia integration simpler.

3. **Canvas**: The `<canvas>` element allows dynamic rendering of graphics, animations, and games through JavaScript.

4. **SVG**: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) can be directly embedded in HTML5, providing a way to create vector graphics for images and animations.

5. **Improved Forms**: HTML5 introduced new form input types like `email`, `url`, `number`, and `date`, as well as attributes like `required` and `pattern` for better form validation.

6. **Local Storage**: The `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs provide client-side storage options, allowing web applications to store data locally.

7. **Geolocation**: HTML5 provides an API for obtaining the user's geographic location, enabling location-aware web applications.

8. **Web Workers**: Web Workers allow running JavaScript code in the background, improving performance and responsiveness by offloading tasks to separate threads.

9. **WebSockets**: Real-time communication is facilitated through the WebSocket API, enabling full-duplex communication between the server and client.

10. **Offline Web Applications**: HTML5 introduced the Application Cache (AppCache) and Service Workers for creating offline-capable web apps.

11. **Responsive Design**: Media queries and CSS3 make it easier to create responsive web designs that adapt to various screen sizes and devices.

12. **Improved Accessibility**: HTML5 includes features for better accessibility, such as the `<details>` and `<summary>` elements for collapsible content.

13. **Cross-document Messaging**: The `postMessage` API allows secure communication between windows or iframes.

14. **Drag and Drop**: HTML5 introduced native drag-and-drop support, making it simpler to implement this feature in web applications.

15. **Web Storage**: HTML5 provides the `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs for storing data on the client-side, reducing the need for cookies.

16. **New Structural Elements**: Elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and `<article>` provide clearer page structure and semantics.

17. **Improved Parsing Rules**: HTML5 has more consistent parsing rules, reducing browser inconsistencies.

18. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: HTML5 introduced CORS, allowing secure cross-origin requests for resources like fonts, scripts, and images.

19. **Dynamic 2D Graphics**: HTML5's `<canvas>` element allows for dynamic rendering of 2D graphics and animations.

20. **Enhanced Security**: HTML5 has improved security features like the `Content Security Policy (CSP)` for mitigating cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

These are some of the key features that HTML5 brought to web development, making it a more powerful and versatile platform for creating modern web applications.
