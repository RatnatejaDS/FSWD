Q . What are HTML Entities? List out 5 commonly used HTML entities?

HTML entities are special codes or character references used in HTML to represent characters that have special meanings in HTML or characters that cannot be easily typed using a keyboard. They are written as an ampersand (`&`) followed by a code or name, and they end with a semicolon (`;`). HTML entities are used to display reserved characters, symbols, or characters with special formatting requirements.

Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

1. `&lt;` - Less Than Sign (`<`): This entity is used to display the less than symbol ("<") in HTML, and it's commonly used when you want to display code examples or prevent HTML tags from being interpreted as markup.

2. `&gt;` - Greater Than Sign (`>`): Similar to `&lt;`, this entity is used to display the greater than symbol (">") in HTML.

3. `&amp;` - Ampersand (`&`): This entity is used to display the ampersand symbol ("&") itself in HTML. It's necessary because an unescaped ampersand can be interpreted as the start of an entity.

4. `&quot;` - Double Quotation Mark (`"`): This entity represents a double quotation mark (" ") and is commonly used to display quoted text within HTML attributes.

5. `&copy;` - Copyright Symbol (`©`): This entity displays the copyright symbol "©" in HTML, typically used to indicate copyright ownership.

These entities ensure that special characters are correctly displayed in web content without causing parsing errors or conflicts with HTML markup.
